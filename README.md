# 4Mata Community SharePoint Lists Samples

Sharing your work with the community is one of the most empowering things you can do. We encourage everyone to share their knowledge to increase the adoption and rapid development for SharePoint list formatting. When you share your work, we will review the project, and once approved & committed; you will see your beautiful project under community templates allowing anyone to use it within 4Mata and Github. We thank you for sharing your love with the community ‚ù§.
